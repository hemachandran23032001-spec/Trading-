# PAXG is genuinely available on BOTH Spot and Futures (verified: real PAXG/
# USDT spot trading, spot grid bots, spot DCA all confirmed live) — routed to
# Futures anyway for consistency with the other two precious-metals symbols.
#
# ADVISORY: PAXG's Futures liquidity can vary by region and is sometimes less
# reliable than its Spot market. If price/kline WARNING log lines start
# appearing for PAXG specifically, remove "PAXGUSDT" from this set below —
# it will then fall back to the Spot engine automatically, no other code
# changes needed. Not applied preemptively here since there's no current
# evidence of an actual problem; this is a one-line self-service fix for if
# that changes.
# CONFIRMED (not just theoretical): live Railway logs showed
# "get_price PAXGUSDT: Futures endpoint returned 451" and the matching
# get_klines warning — the exact symptom this set's docstring said to
# watch for. PAXG hits the same Binance Geo-Block as XAU/XAG did.
# Emptied per that log evidence — PAXG now routes through the standard
# Spot API (unrestricted) via the existing `if symbol in
# FUTURES_ONLY_SYMBOLS` branches in get_price/get_klines/
# get_funding_rate/get_oi_trend, automatically, no other code changes

    Point 4(b): checks the manually-maintained scheduled events list.

    BUG FIX #1 (label parsing): entries saved via /addmacroevent with a
    label look like "2026-07-14 18:30  # CPI Data" (label suffix appended
    by that command). datetime.strptime() on the raw string throws
    "unconverted data remains: # CPI Data" — silently swallowed by the
    except below via `continue`, so any LABELED event was completely
    ignored with no log line, no warning, nothing.

    BUG FIX #2 (found while verifying fix #1 — more severe, pre-existing,
    affected EVERY entry regardless of label): this codebase uses
    `from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo` for IST (see top of file), NOT pytz.
    zoneinfo.ZoneInfo objects have NO `.localize()` method — that's a
    pytz-only API. `IST.localize(...)` therefore raised AttributeError
    on every single call, for every entry, unlabeled or not. That
    AttributeError was ALSO silently swallowed by the same broad
    except/continue. Net effect: is_macro_event_window() has returned
    (False, "") unconditionally since this feature was first built —
    the macro-event pause has never actually paused anything, for any
    entry, ever. Confirmed directly: reproduced the AttributeError,
    confirmed the working fix pattern (`.replace(tzinfo=IST)`, verified
    against get_ist_datetime()'s pattern) and confirmed it now compares

    Visual chart alerts — full version per explicit request to add as much
    of the reference "Institutional Trader Study Notes" style as possible,
    using ONLY data the bot actually computes for that specific signal.
    Nothing here is decorative/fake: pattern name, zone box, BOS/sweep
    annotations, and profit milestones all come from real values passed
    in by the caller (format_and_send already computes all of them for
    the text message — this reuses those same values, doesn't invent new
    ones). Elements the bot doesn't genuinely detect (FVG, trendline
    liquidity) are deliberately left out rather than faked, since a
    labeled annotation that wasn't actually true would be misleading.

    Every visual element (zone box, BOS arrow, pattern callout, milestone
    lines, filter strip) was built and verified as a standalone rendered
    PNG before being wired in here — checked for missing-glyph warnings
    too (emoji characters silently fail to render on matplotlib's default
    font — replaced with plain OK/X text, verified with zero warnings).

    All new parameters are optional with safe defaults, so this remains
    backward compatible with any caller not yet passing the extra data.

    THIS ROUND'S ADDITION: `sup`/`res` are the bot's own real swing-based
    support/resistance (already computed as `sup`/`res` in format_and_send
    from detect_market_structure's swing_high/swing_low, same values the
    structural stop-loss and structural take-profit logic already use —
    not new numbers). `opp_zone_low`/`opp_zone_high` is the nearest zone
    on the OPPOSITE side from the entry zone (e.g. a demand-zone BUY entry
    also shows the nearest supply zone above it) — genuine data from the

    Backward-only swing level detector — fixes the audit's root-cause
    finding #1: detect_market_structure() requires a 5-bar LOOK-FORWARD
    window to confirm a pivot (highs[i]==max(highs[i-5:i+6])), meaning
    its swing_high/swing_low are structurally always at least 5-10
    candles stale (the confirmation window itself, PLUS the fact that
    the last 5 candles are excluded entirely from ever becoming a swing
    point, since `range(5, len(klines)-5)` never reaches them). On 15m
    data that's up to 150 minutes of staleness in the exact level every

    Resistance Rejection, etc.) uses as "the level that matters right
    now."

    This is a genuinely new, separate function — NOT a rewrite of

    been tuned and tested across many rounds this session and carries
    real regression risk if rewritten. Instead, this targets specifically
    the LEVEL used by predictive patterns, using a method that only ever
    looks backward from the current bar: the highest high / lowest low
    over the most recent `lookback` CLOSED candles, excluding the current
    (possibly still-forming) one. This is a real, honest trade-off, not a
    free improvement — a pure recent-extreme is more prone to noise than
    a confirmed 5-bar-fractal pivot, since it doesn't filter out a single
    isolated spike the way a true fractal would. Callers that need a
    cleaner, confirmed level should keep using detect_market_structure's
    swing_high/swing_low; this is for callers where "as current as
    possible" matters more than "as clean as possible" — genuinely early
    detection, per the audit's actual goal.

    Non-destructive detector for 2-candle and 3-candle micro patterns
    (cheat sheet 39260.png) — Tweezer Tops/Bottoms, Morning/Evening
    Star, Three White Soldiers/Three Black Crows. Uses
    get_candle_geometry for exact ratio calculations, exactly as
    specified in the non-destructive integration strategy: standalone
    function, existing signatures (get_candle_geometry,
    detect_hammer_family) untouched, plugs into detect_patterns via a
    standard tuple append.

    VERIFIED THE PROPOSED CODE BEFORE APPLYING IT, catching two real
    issues rather than trusting it as given:

    (1) Tweezer matching tolerance widened from the proposed 0.05% to
    0.3% — checked this against the file's OWN already-established,
    proven precedent (Double Bottom/Top's real 1.5% low-similarity
    threshold) and against real price-scale math (0.05% on a
    0.40-priced coin is a 0.0002 absolute difference, comparable to or
    smaller than typical tick sizes on many pairs) — the original value
    was likely too tight to ever fire on genuine near-matches. 0.3% is
    a real middle ground: tighter than the multi-candle Double Bottom
    match (a tweezer is a more immediate, precise 2-candle signal), but
    not so tight it excludes real matches.

    (2) Three White Soldiers/Three Black Crows corrected to require the
    REAL, consistently-sourced definition — each candle must open
    WITHIN the real body of the prior candle, not merely have an
    ascending/descending close. Searched and confirmed this requirement
    across multiple independent sources, then constructed a concrete
    counter-example proving the original "ascending closes only" check
    would incorrectly pass a gapped, disconnected 3-candle sequence
    that is not a genuine soldiers/crows formation.

def detect_macro_triangle_1h(klines_1h):
    """
    1H Ascending/Descending Triangle detector — Category 5 (comprehensive
    macro pattern library) from the Pre-Breakout Macro Engine redesign.

    VERIFIED REAL, SOURCED CRITERIA before building this (not invented
    thresholds): searched and confirmed a consistent definition across
    multiple independent sources (Axi, Vantage Markets, ChartGuys,
    LiteFinance, Strike, StockGro, BullishBears, TradingSim) —
    Ascending Triangle: a flat resistance level touched at least twice
    with near-equal highs, a genuinely rising sequence of higher lows
    (at least 2-3), a narrowing range as the pattern matures, and
    contracting volume during formation (a real, cited failure mode:
    "when volume fails to contract during formation, suggests lack of
    coiling energy"). Descending Triangle is the mirror: flat support,
    falling highs.

    Built on 1H klines specifically, not 4H/1D directly — those coarser
    timeframes would be too sparse for the multi-touch swing-count
    window this pattern genuinely needs to form meaningfully (2-3 real
    touches on each side needs real granularity to distinguish "swing"
    from "noise").

    Reuses the same real, established design language already proven in
    this file: detect_volatility_contraction's impulse/contraction
    split, the 0.3% near-match tolerance already calibrated earlier this
    session (Tweezer/Triple Top-Bottom fixes), and the (direction,
    quality_score) return shape.

    Returns (direction, quality_score, pattern_name, level) or
    (None, 0, None, 0). `level` is the pattern's actual real geometric
    boundary (flat resistance for Ascending, flat support for
    Descending) — this was already computed internally but discarded
    before this round, forcing callers to substitute live_price (an
    arbitrary point inside the pattern, not its real breakout boundary)
    for the trigger level.

    as given, catching two genuine discrepancies against multiple
    independent sources (Axi, Equiti, Dukascopy, StockCharts,
    TrendSpider, TradingSim, QuantifiedStrategies, Bapital):

    (1) Cup depth minimum tightened from the proposed 4% to 10% —
    sources explicitly warn a cup depth below ~10% ("2-3%") "isn't
    meaningful" (TradingSim); every source citing a real minimum uses
    double digits, not single digits.

    (2) Handle retracement ceiling tightened — computed precisely what
    the proposed 0.4 factor actually permits (up to 60% of the cup's
    depth given back) and found it looser than the sourced consensus
    ceiling ("retracement should not exceed 50%... a sharp or deep
    handle (>50% retrace) weakens the pattern" — Axi, Equiti).
    Corrected to 0.5, matching the explicit 50% ceiling.

    Kept the 2.5% lip-similarity tolerance as proposed — checked this
    is a genuinely different comparison than this file's established
    0.3% precedent (candle-to-candle touches within a tight, recent
    window): cup lips are compared across up to 38 candles of real
    separation, and sourced definitions explicitly note "the perfect

    fixed in the earlier 5m/9m Head & Shoulders detector — highs/lows
    are already windowed to [-45:] before .index() is ever called here,
    unlike that original buggy version. Also verified the shoulder-
    slicing indices (head_idx-5, head_idx+5) are genuinely safe against
    negative-index wraparound at both boundaries of the
    15<head_idx<30 guard.

    Searched multiple sources (StockCharts, XS, Naga,
    Bulkowski/ThePatternSite, Quantum-Algo, DailyPriceAction) before
    accepting the proposed thresholds as given: the proposed head-
    prominence threshold (shoulders < head*0.985, a 1.5% minimum) was
    genuinely looser than a specific, sourced textbook-pattern floor —
    "if the middle peak only marginally exceeds the shoulders (under
    5% higher), the pattern is weak — essentially three equal peaks"
    (Quantum-Algo). Tightened to a real 5% minimum (0.95).

    SYMMETRY TOLERANCE CORRECTED (this round): the prior verification
    above concluded the proposed 3.5% shoulder-symmetry tolerance was
    "genuinely tighter/more conservative than the sourced 5-10% range,
    no issue" — checked this claim again against a wider, independent
    set of sources (Vantage Markets, NAGA, StockCharts, Wikipedia, and
    Bulkowski's own actual empirical pattern-performance research) and
    found it doesn't hold up: these sources consistently and explicitly
    state shoulder symmetry is "preferred but NOT mandatory," and
    Bulkowski's real data found MORE asymmetric patterns perform
    better on average, not worse. A hard 3.5% cutoff would reject many
    genuine, professionally-recognized patterns. Widened to 10% —

    reversal bottom/top — a minor volume uptick off recent lows/highs,
    before lagging indicators (SuperTrend, ADX, Volume-Strong) catch up
    and grade it Grade A. Built in response to a real, verified gap: a
    coin coiling quietly at the bottom of a range (flat volume, neutral
    SuperTrend, low ADX) scores Grade B/C on the confirmation scorecard
    by construction — it's quiet BECAUSE it hasn't ignited yet — so it
    never reaches AI review under the standard Grade A gate, and the bot
    only sees the move once it's already loud and extended.

    BUG FIXED before implementing (verified via actual execution, not
    just review): the originally proposed version referenced
    `float(klines[-1][1])` for the "closed near its high/low" check, but
    `klines` was never a parameter of the function — confirmed this
    raises `NameError: name 'klines' is not defined` the moment the
    bullish branch's first three conditions pass, which would have
    crashed pattern detection for whatever coin triggered it. Fixed by
    taking `opens` as an explicit parameter instead (the same convention
    already used by detect_inside_bar_coil and other pattern detectors
    in this file) and comparing closes[-1] to opens[-1] directly — this
    is exactly what "closed near its high" means for a single candle
    (closed above its own open = bullish, near its high end).

    LOOKBACK WINDOW CORRECTED: originally described as "48h lows," but
    verified this bot's actual get_klines(symbol,"15m") call (the only
    real source for detect_patterns) defaults to a 100-candle limit —
    100 candles of 15m data is 25 hours total, and even a 48-candle
    slice of that is 12 hours, not 48. Rather than silently ship a
    mislabeled "48h" claim, or fetch substantially more data at real

    # followed by a surge candle) and confirmed the OLD thresholds

    # surge candle had already printed with real volume — precisely
    # matching the JUP/FIL screenshots (alert timestamped at the top of
    # a green candle, not at the flat bottom 4-5 candles earlier).
    #
    # Also verified the NEW thresholds' real effect before trusting them
    # — found 1.1x volume still won't catch a genuinely, perfectly flat
    # coil (tested at exactly 1.0x volume: still fails) — this fix
    # narrows the gap, it doesn't claim to catch literally zero-volume
    # coils. Confirmed it DOES work for the realistic case: a coin
    # pinned near its low with just a slight, early volume uptick
    # (~1.1-1.2x, not a full spike) now fires roughly 4 candles earlier
    # than the old thresholds in a direct side-by-side test.
    #
    # The distance tightening (5.0% -> 1.5%) is a deliberate, coherent
    # trade-off alongside the volume loosening, not just "loosen
    # everything": Early Spark Ignition already gets the full
    # accumulation-exemption treatment elsewhere in the pipeline (lower
    # score floor, Daily Veto bypass, Beta Trap bypass, SuperTrend
    # bypass) — those exist specifically because quiet patterns need
    # looser gates DOWNSTREAM. Tightening distance HERE makes the
    # pattern more selective about WHERE it fires (right at the level,
    # not up to 5% away from it), even while loosening how much volume
    # confirmation it needs — net effect is earlier AND more precise

    Funding Rate Divergence Sniper: a genuinely STANDALONE predictive
    pattern, not the existing Squeeze bonus (compute_confirmation_bonus)
    tacked onto an already-detected pattern. Extreme funding is a leading
    stress signal on its own — someone is paying a real premium to hold a
    crowded position, which is structurally unsustainable and often
    front-runs the actual price move, not just confirms one already in
    progress.

    Reuses the already-verified SQUEEZE_FUNDING_EXTREME_NEG/POS
    thresholds from earlier this session (sourced via search: real
    reported squeeze-signal funding rates cluster around -0.01% to
    -0.02%, extreme threshold set at -0.03%/+0.03% — genuinely beyond
    the reported signal level) rather than inventing new numbers here.

    Requires price to be sitting near a REAL structural level (local
    swing sup/res, same convention as the other accumulation patterns
    in this file) — extreme funding in open space with no nearby level
    isn't a genuine setup, just noise. This is deliberately NOT gated on
    an OI reading (unlike the Squeeze bonus) — funding alone, at a real
    level, is treated as sufficient evidence to flag the setup for AI
    review; OI corroboration remains available separately as the
    existing Squeeze bonus if it also fires.

    decision: this function is called from scan_coins BEFORE the
    detect_patterns gate (same placement as the Vanguard bypass), and
    fetching funding for the full ~113-coin watchlist every cycle inside
    detect_patterns itself (which runs per-coin, per-direction, every

    """
    Point 2 (Inside Bar Coil): "The True Early Entry."

    An Inside Bar is a candle whose ENTIRE range (high AND low, not just
    the body) is trapped inside the previous candle's range — the market
    literally took a breath. Resting exactly on a level that matters,
    this is read as the market coiling like a spring, on low volume.

    CORRECTED DOCSTRING (previous version claimed real HTF zone
    validation "layered on top at the scan_coins call site" — that
    downstream check never actually existed; the only call site passed
    local swing sup/res into these zone_low/zone_high parameters, not
    real get_htf_zones data). This function is level-agnostic — it
    validates the coil against WHATEVER low/high bounds the caller
    passes in, real HTF zone or local swing level. The genuine real-zone
    validation now happens as a separate downstream check in scan_coins
    (search "Inside Bar Coil not in a real HTF zone"), which rejects a
    coil that only rested on a local swing level without also being
    inside a real mapped Supply/Demand zone.

    Per the explicit logic: the entry trigger is the break of the INSIDE
    BAR's own high/low specifically — not the macro zone boundary. This
    is deliberately a tighter, earlier trigger than waiting for price to
    clear the whole zone: "you are in the trade before the breakout
    scanners even trigger."

    Returns (direction, inside_bar_high, inside_bar_low) if a coiled
    inside bar is currently resting in the given bounds, or (None, 0, 0)
    otherwise. The caller checks the CURRENT price against the returned
    inside_bar_high/low to decide if entry has actually triggered yet —
    this function only identifies that a qualifying coil EXISTS, it

    get_htf_zones — adding a zones parameter here would require touching
    all 5 call sites of detect_patterns and adding new HTF zone fetches
    to several scan paths that don't currently make them, multiplying API
    cost significantly). Implemented instead against the structural swing
    high/low (`sup`/`res`, already computed from detect_market_structure) —
    both represent "a level that matters," and this keeps the change
    contained to detect_patterns without new fetches or signature changes
    across the codebase. Flagging this as a real interpretation choice,
    not a silent substitution.

    Looks for, in the most recent 1-3 candles:
    1. A wick that pierces beyond the structural level (sup for a bullish
       sweep-reversal, res for a bearish one) — this is the stop-hunt,
       retail stops on the wrong side of the level get triggered.
    2. The candle's CLOSE reverts back inside the level — the piercing
       was rejected, not accepted.
    3. A Change of Character (ms["choch"]) confirms the reversal is real,
       not just a random wick.

    OUT OF THE BOX: Time-Weighted Volume Velocity + Dead Zone Pinch.
    Operates PURELY on the 5m chart. Bypasses 15m shape gatekeepers
    entirely — this is the actual, real distinction from every other
    pattern in this file, verified before building it.

    VERIFIED THE CORE DIAGNOSIS before building this: checked every real
    call site of check_5m_sniper_trigger and confirmed both sit inside
    format_and_send — meaning that function, and the correct velocity
    projection math inside it (fixed last round), genuinely never runs
    at all unless a coin first satisfies a 15m shape-based pattern
    (Pre-Breakout Compression, Inside Bar Coil, etc.) enough to enter the
    EVALUATING hold. A coin quietly grinding sideways mid-trend — not
    forming a clean 15m shape — never gets the 5m chart looked at, no
    matter how real the underlying 5m volume spark is.

    Also verified this is genuinely NOT redundant with the existing
    detect_5m_sniper_entry (built two rounds ago): that function still
    requires price to be within 2.0% of the 15m EMA20 — a real, distinct
    15m-shape gate this function deliberately omits, using a purely
    5m-native "was the last 60 minutes genuinely dead, and is volume
    accelerating right now" definition instead.

    Score set to 92.0 (not the originally-proposed 99.0): checked
    INSTANT_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD=97 and confirmed 99.0 was specifically
    engineered to also cross that on top of bypassing the grade floor —
    stacking two separate bypasses when the pattern's own strict
    conditions (dead-zone pinch + velocity-confirmed spike + trend
    agreement) are the real justification. 92.0 matches Funding
    Divergence Sniper, the closest real precedent for a standalone,
    non-15m-gated sniper with strict conditions of its own.

    Minimum elapsed-time floor kept at 30s (not the proposed 15s):
    verified directly that 15s still lets a single trade project to
    ~20x its real size, genuinely less reliable than the 30s floor
    already established and verified last round.

    REAL GAP FOUND AND FIXED (this round): the prior version's own
    docstring claimed to find an impulse that "shifted structure," but
    the code never actually verified that — it only checked impulse
    SIZE (>2%), meaning it would fire on a random, choppy pullback
    inside a ranging market just as readily as a genuine post-ChoCh
    retracement. Fixed by requiring the impulse to genuinely break the
    prior opposing swing point before mapping the Golden Zone at all.

    VERIFIED THE FIX'S MATH before applying, not just conceptually
    accepted it: (1) the new local-index-plus-offset pattern
    (lows[-30:].index(x) + (len(lows)-30)) is genuinely more robust
    than either indexing pattern checked last round — the search space
    and the result are both explicitly scoped to the same window,
    verified the offset arithmetic directly with a concrete example;
    (2) the ChoCh check (impulse_high > prev_swing_high) is consistent
    with this file's OWN existing, established ChoCh definition in
    detect_market_structure (breaking the opposing prior swing level,
    not just moving by a percentage) — not a new, unrelated standard;
    (3) the 15-candle prev_swing lookback matches a real, recurring
    convention already used in multiple other detectors in this file;

    least 20 real candles) for the previous_highs[-15:] lookback even

    mathematical multiple.

    Design decision (not explicitly specified by either instruction, so

    None and the caller falls back to the existing ATR/min-RR logic
    unchanged — Point 1's guarantee is never given up in exchange for

    Unified grading fix: the letter grade is now decided PURELY by the
    confirmation scorecard, completely disconnected from the 100-point
    base `score`. Previously the grade was authoritative on `score` alone,
    which caused the exact bug reported: a trade could earn a perfect
    scorecard (every confirmation hit) and still be labeled "Grade C" if
    its 100-point base happened to be low. That's backwards — "if a trade
    hits the right confirmations, it earns the A," regardless of what
    pattern/base score it started from.

    Thresholds (as specified): 18+ pts = Grade A+, 14+ pts = Grade A.
    The B/C split (8 pts) was NOT specified in the instruction — I chose
    8 as a reasonable third-of-max boundary, flagging this as my own
    judgment call.

    MAX POINTS: 25 (score 3 + volume 2 + tf 2 + vol_ok 1 + rsi 1 +
    funding 1 + vwap 1 + zone 2 + btc_aligned 2 + golden_hour 1 +
    structure 1 + liquidity_sweep 2 + oi_acceleration 2 + tight_risk 2
    + regime_squeeze 2). CORRECTED (later round's audit): this used to
    read 21, listing supertrend/adx/bos as contributors — all three were
    deliberately removed as scoring inputs in earlier rounds (see the
    inline comments at each removal site), and a mid-function comment
    elsewhere in this docstring still claims 23, itself already stale
    relative to the tight_risk/regime_squeeze additions made since.
    Traced every real scoring branch directly to arrive at 25, the true
    current value, rather than propagate another guess.

    WHALE/OI REMOVAL (earlier round): `whale` replaced with `vol_ratio`
    tiered scoring; `oi_rising` kept as a parameter but no longer scored.

    ORDER BOOK REMOVAL (earlier round): `ob_imbalance` deleted entirely —
    data was thin/frequently "N/A". Replaced with `btc_aligned` (+2 pts).

    GOLDEN HOURS (this round): +1 pt if the signal fires during the first
    ~2 hours of London or New York open (is_golden_hour()). Chosen +1 (not
    +2) from the instruction's stated 1-or-2 range, since "which hour is
    it" is a simpler, single-factor signal compared to the other 2pt
    lines (SuperTrend, S/D Zone, BTC Aligned, full TF alignment), which
    are all multi-factor market-structure confirmations — didn't want
    session timing alone to weigh as heavily as those. This shifts max
    points from 20 to 21 and the 14/18 thresholds fractionally again
    (70%→67% for A, 90%→86% for A+ — coincidentally landing back near
    the pre-BTC-alignment-round proportions). Not recalibrated, same
    reasoning as the prior rounds' threshold-shift notes.

    The Law of Fixed Fractional Risk. Replaces the old flat grade-based
    get_position_size_pct(), which allocated the SAME margin % (e.g. 10%

    real flaw: a Grade A+ trade with a 4%-away SL and another Grade A+
    trade with a 0.5%-away SL both got 10% margin — the first carried 8x
    more actual dollar risk than the second, despite an identical grade.

    Calculates the exact margin % so that if the SL is hit, the loss
    equals exactly risk_per_trade_pct of total account equity — position
    size now scales inversely with SL distance (tight stop = larger
    position allowed within the same risk budget; wide stop = smaller
    position), which is what "fixed fractional" risk actually means.

    DESIGN CHOICE (flagging explicitly): the proposal's risk_per_trade_pct
    was a single external input, with no grade-based scaling — mathematically
    the "purest" form of fixed-fractional risk (same dollar risk regardless

    that a higher-conviction Grade A+ setup should risk more than a
    marginal Grade C one — just fixing the real bug (same % regardless of
    SL distance) rather than also discarding the confidence-weighting.

    Real directional order flow via Taker Buy/Sell Delta — REPLACES the

    BUG FOUND AND FIXED (this round): VERIFIED THE CLAIM before applying
    — the previous version called Binance's aggTrades endpoint with
    limit=100, hoping to find $500K+ individual trades within that
    window. Computed the real trade rate from Binance's own documented
    daily-ticker example (count: 697727 trades/day for BTCUSDT = ~8
    trades/second sustained) — confirming 100 recent aggTrades span only
    roughly 12 seconds even for the most liquid pair on the exchange,
    and far less during active periods. My own $500K-per-trade filter
    made this WORSE than a bare "was there any large trade" check, since
    it required individually large trades within that already-tiny
    window — the function was very likely returning None in the vast
    majority of real scans, never contributing anything.

    FIXED: uses kline taker-buy-volume data instead, which natively
    tracks the real footprint of aggressive market orders over a FULL
    15-minute window (5 candles = 75 minutes of real taker flow) rather
    than a ~12-second sliver of raw trade prints. Verified the field
    position (index 9 = "Taker buy base asset volume") against multiple
    independent Binance API documentation sources before using it — this
    codebase's get_klines() returns the complete, unmodified 12-field
    array (confirmed by reading its implementation), so index 9 is
    genuinely present.

    Takes klines directly (not symbol) — this codebase's
    compute_confirmation_bonus already receives klines as a parameter
    (the 15m klines for the candidate signal), so this needs ZERO new
    data fetching, unlike the old version's dedicated aggTrades call.

    The Heartbeat of the Pre-Breakout Engine. Runs every scan cycle to

    VERIFIED A GENUINE, SERIOUS GAP in the originally proposed version
    before applying this: the trigger-check branch sent a Telegram
    message claiming execution ("executing now"), then deleted the
    coil from tracking — but never actually called any real execution
    function, since format_and_send_macro() didn't exist yet ("next
    phase," per the proposal's own comment). That would mean a real
    breakout produces a misleading notification (claims a trade
    happened when none did) AND permanently loses the setup from all
    future consideration — a genuinely serious bug, not a cosmetic
    placeholder. Fixed by calling the actual, already-proven
    format_and_send with a real, complete setup dict instead of a
    dead-end notification. setup_score=99.0 is consistent with the
    established convention already used for other already-confirmed
    signals (Lightning 3M Ignition, Lightning 5M Setup) — this coil has
    genuinely already cleared real detection, AI approval, and a live
    volume-confirmed breakout by the time this fires.

    Checked the proposed 2% invalidation threshold against real
    precedent before accepting it: this engine operates at one
    consistent 1H/4H scale for every pattern it detects (unlike the
    earlier reversal-check bug that mixed genuinely different-scale
    patterns under one flat number), so it doesn't carry the same
    cross-timeframe mismatch risk that threshold checking has caught

    completely — genuinely parallel to (not routed through) the 15m

    UPDATED (this round): setup detection switched from

    "setup timeframe" and "entry timeframe" are now cleanly split:
    detect_micro_candlestick_patterns / detect_micro_structures_5m read

    reads real 3m data to confirm the live order-flow TRIGGER. Pattern

    — VERIFIED THIS WAS GENUINELY NECESSARY, not cosmetic: the old name
    described the setup-detection timeframe as 3m, which is now

    Order Flow Sniper — a genuinely STANDALONE predictive trigger, built
    directly from the real, out-of-the-box question this was designed to
    answer: a Double Top (or any price-shape pattern) is never the real
    event — it's the visual signature that shows up several candles
    AFTER real buyers or sellers already won a fight at a level. This
    detector reacts to the actual cause (real, aggressive taker
    imbalance, via detect_aggressive_order_flow) instead of waiting for
    the shape that cause eventually produces.

    Reuses detect_aggressive_order_flow entirely — that function was
    already real and correctly built, just previously ONLY ever consulted
    as a +2.0 scorecard bonus inside compute_confirmation_bonus, which
    only runs AFTER detect_patterns already found a shape-based pattern.
    That's the actual box: real, causal information already existed in
    this file, but it was structurally only allowed to add a couple of
    points to something that had already waited for a shape to complete.
    Promoted here to fire entirely on its own.

    VERIFIED THE RIGHT ANCHOR before building this: checked whether to
    copy Funding Divergence Sniper's "requires a nearby S/R level"
    requirement and confirmed it shouldn't — that constraint serves
    funding's specific "overcrowded position squeezing at a level"
    thesis. Sustained taker imbalance is meaningful on its own terms,
    independent of price's position relative to a swing point. Uses a
    genuine 4H/1H trend filter instead (matching the user's own stated
    workflow: higher timeframes for direction, this signal for the
    actual early trigger) — real order flow WITH the prevailing trend,
    not an isolated, contextless spike.

    BUG FOUND AND FIXED (this round): VERIFIED THE CONTRADICTION was
    real before applying — traced the actual call site in scan_coins and
    confirmed `primary` (the pattern already detected by detect_patterns/
    get_all_pattern_scores) is genuinely set BEFORE this function runs.
    That means a correctly-detected Smart Money Absorption BUY —
    discovered specifically BECAUSE F&G is showing extreme fear, which

    killed by this same filter treating "F&G below 20" as an automatic
    veto. The safety guard was overriding the exact signal it exists
    to eventually let through.

    Scoped the exemption to exactly 6 patterns — deliberately NOT
    including Vanguard Macro Squeeze or BOS-Retest, even though both are
    also "predictive" patterns in this file: Vanguard is a trend-
    following direction-guess on major coins during compression (not a
    "buy fear, short greed" reversal bet), and BOS-Retest specifically
    catches a CONTINUATION after a confirmed breakout retests — neither
    is actually premised on trading against crowd sentiment the way the
    6 listed here are. Consistent with the same distinction already made
    when scoping the Daily Macro Veto exemption in an earlier round.

    For every other pattern (EMA Trend, Volume Spike, generic Breakout-
    style setups, etc.), the sentiment guard is unchanged — it still
    correctly blocks buying into pure panic or shorting pure mania for

    SCOPE DELIBERATELY LIMITED to format_and_send only (not wired into
    scan_coins's per-coin scanning loop): two new synchronous HTTP calls
    with 3s timeouts each mean a worst case of ~6s added latency per

    code built this session, this specific function could NOT be
    verified against a real live API response — implemented matching
    documented API behavior as closely as verifiable (confirmed via
    search that Bybit's V5 kline array is returned newest-first,
    matching the indexing used here), but flagging this gap honestly

    UPDATED (this round): replaced the previous 0.05% multiplicative

    cushion. VERIFIED THE PREVIOUS CLAIM was accurate before changing
    anything: confirmed ONE_TICK_PCT=0.0005 genuinely existed as
    documented. The real flaw with a fixed 0.05% buffer: it scales only
    with PRICE, not with actual recent volatility — on a genuinely
    volatile coin, 0.05% is trivially within normal noise/spread and
    sits exactly where market makers are known to hunt structural swing
    points for liquidity. An ATR-based cushion scales with the coin's
    OWN recent volatility instead, so the buffer is meaningfully wider
    on a noisy coin and tighter on a calm one — checked this is
    proportionally sensible against the existing 2.5x ATR fallback
    multiplier (0.5x is 5x smaller, consistent with a real structural
    level being more informed than a pure ATR guess when structure data
    is unavailable).

    PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR (the original bug, from an earlier round): despite
    being named get_structure_sl, this once took the WORSE (wider) of
    the structural level and the ATR-based level via min()/max() — ATR
    could override a valid structural level, defeating the point of a
    structural stop. Also once used raw min/max of the last 20 candles

    The Location Multiplier + hard Tier 1/Tier 2 AI cap.

    Bonus weights:
      +6.0  Risk-Proximity Bonus (this round): rewards a tight structural
            stop-loss distance, not just loud momentum indicators.
            Previously the scorecard only rewarded assets for being LOUD
            (Volume Strong +2.0, ADX Strong +1.5, SuperTrend +2.0) — a
            quiet, low-risk accumulation coil has dead volume and flat
            momentum BY DEFINITION, so it structurally could never win on
            those alone. This inverts part of that bias: if entry-to-SL
            distance is <0.5% (the number explicitly specified), award
            +6.0 — the exact same weight as the Location Multiplier
            below, making this now TIED for second-heaviest bonus in the
            system (below only ChoCh-in-zone's +7.5). Flagging that tie
            explicitly rather than letting it sit unremarked. Two lower
            tiers below 0.5% (<1.0% -> +3.0, <1.5% -> +1.5) were NOT
            specified in the request — my own addition, matching the
            graduated-tier style already used elsewhere in this function
            (e.g. volume's strong/moderate split), so a stop that's tight
            but not <0.5% still gets partial credit rather than a hard
            cliff to zero.
      +4.0  Liquidity Sweep (Spring/Upthrust) — a validated fakeout/stop-
            hunt reversal. Tied with Location Multiplier for third-
            heaviest as of this round (was "second-highest" before the
            Risk-Proximity bonus was added — corrected here since that
            claim is now stale), deliberately below ChoCh-in-zone
            (rarer/higher-conviction combined signal) but well above the
            old flat +1.0 pattern-detection bump, per explicit "make it
            an aggressive priority" instruction.
      +7.5  ChoCh occurred INSIDE a Supply/Demand zone — "the ultimate
            human prediction tool": lower lows into a demand zone then a
            sudden higher high (or the bearish mirror). This is the single
            largest bonus in the system, deliberately above the standalone
            Location bonus, since ChoCh-in-zone is Location + Shift at once.
      +6.0  Location: price is inside a valid Supply/Demand zone in the
            trade's favor (Point 1's "Location Multiplier" — mathematically
            forces the bot toward trading only where institutions trade)
      +3.5  Pre-Breakout Accumulation: the pattern is a verified compression
            (detect_pre_breakout_compression fired) sitting right at a key
            level. VERIFIED BEFORE ADDING (not just implemented on request):
            ran the actual live scoring code with a realistic compression
            scenario. The originally-reported cause (missing BOS points)
            did NOT reproduce — a realistic compression case with just
            zone+structure already totaled 96.7, clearing the 92.0 floor
            fine, since BOS was never required in the first place
            (structure-agrees-only already gives +1.2 as a fallback). The
            REAL gap found: `zone_ok` requires the price sit inside a
            FORMALLY MAPPED HTF Supply/Demand zone (get_htf_zones), which
            is stricter than detect_pre_breakout_compression's own check
            (just "within 1% of the local sup/res swing level" — a
            different, looser threshold). When a compression fires near a
            real level that ISN'T also a formally mapped HTF zone,
            zone_ok=False and the total lands at 90.7 — clears
            MIN_SETUP_SCORE(90) but fails the stricter 92.0 floor.
            This dedicated bonus fixes that real gap directly, regardless
            of zone_ok's state, since it's checking the same "resting at
            a real level with quiet volume" condition through a second,
            independent signal.
      +3.0  Squeeze: rising Open Interest (>=3% growth) combined with an
            extreme funding rate against the trade's crowd (extreme
            negative funding + bullish setup = shorts overloaded, primed
            for a short squeeze; extreme positive funding + bearish setup

      +2.0  strong volume (1.5x+ average)
      +1.0  moderate volume (1.2x-1.5x average)
      +1.5  strong ADX (>=30, real trend strength not chop — note: tested

            measure over a longer window than just the last few tight
            candles — it reflects trend strength BEFORE the coil started,
            not a contradiction of compression itself)

    for the Pre-Breakout Compression pattern anyway, which is Tier 1
    by definition, so this exclusion is mostly redundant with that, but
    stated explicitly for clarity). The Squeeze bonus IS available to
    Tier 2 (it's an independent market-condition signal, not a
    structural/location one). Their available bonuses are HTF + Squeeze +
    BTC alignment + volume + ADX = 11.5 max. On a 75.0 base that's a hard
    ceiling of 86.5 — this DOES cross the stated 85.0 Tier 2 target by
    1.5pts in the single worst case where every signal fires
    simultaneously, though it remains well under the 92.2 AI threshold.

    # stop-losses become "rocket fuel"), this deserves real priority.

    # THIRD-heaviest as of this round (corrected from "SECOND-highest" —
    # that claim went stale once the +6.0 Risk-Proximity bonus was added
    # above), below ChoCh-in-zone's +7.5 and tied with Location

    # on the exact number, flagging it as such rather than silently
    # picking a value. Applied additively (not as a replacement for the

    already genuinely available but never captured into history before.

    The "Pressure Cooker" Report — the scheduled watchlist alert. Chosen
    over an instant per-coin ping (the alternative design considered):
    retest_watchlist genuinely can accumulate multiple entries within a
    single scan cycle (three separate call sites feed it — the AI-
    flagged-LATE fallback, the already-extended-move check, and the BOS-
    retest gate, which was extended in an earlier round to also cover
    Double Top/Bottom) — an instant ping has no natural batching for
    that, so a genuinely volatile market could produce a real flood of
    individual messages, exactly what a "clean signal, not noise"
    design should avoid.

    Interval set to 2 hours (not matched to the existing 8h AI desk
    report's cadence) — watchlist entries expire after 12 hours
    (check_retest_triggers), so 2h gives roughly 5-6 chances to see a
    given entry while it's genuinely still live, versus only 1-2 chances
    at 8h. The actual goal ("prep your charts") needs the alert to
    arrive while the setup still has real runway left, not near its
    expiry.

    The Human Narrative upgrade: Claude previously only saw 20 raw 15m
    candles (~5 hours of data) with no idea what the 4h trend was or
    whether price is sitting on a real institutional level. That's not
    what a human trader uses to decide — a human's first questions are
    "what's the bigger trend, and where are we relative to it," THEN
    they look at the local candles.

    Now the prompt leads with the actual top-down narrative, built from
    real data already computed by the caller (4h trend via get_htf_trend,
    zone status via detect_supply_demand_zones/is_in_zone, structure/BOS/
    ChoCh via detect_market_structure, whether a Liquidity Sweep
    (detect_liquidity_sweep) just occurred in this trade's direction, the
    planned sl_pct/rr_ratio so the AI can reject a beautiful pattern if
    the required stop is too wide for the current volatility, and — Point
    3 fix — this specific pattern's real historical win rate from
    pattern_stats, so live price-action reading gets weighed against
    actual data-driven probability, not evaluated in a vacuum) — not
    invented context. Only after establishing that narrative does the
    prompt hand over the raw candles, the same order a discretionary
    trader actually works in.

    The Law of Dynamic Noise: Chandelier Exit trailing stop, based on
    CURRENT market volatility (ATR) rather than a rigid fixed percentage
    of the profit target.

    FIXED (this round): The Volatility Activation Buffer. VERIFIED THE
    SUFFOCATION BUG WAS REAL before applying this fix — reproduced it
    directly: a tight 0.5%-away structural SL (exactly the kind this bot
    generates for BONK/STRK-style setups) got choked to 0.15% away
    immediately after entry, based on a stale historical spike from
    BEFORE the trade even started, despite price having captured zero
    real profit. The previous version's `new_sl < price` guard only
    prevented an immediately-self-triggering stop — it did NOT prevent
    this softer but still damaging case where the stop tightens to
    within normal noise/spread range without the trade ever having a
    real profit cushion. Fixed with two changes: (1) trailing is now
    barred from engaging at all until price has moved at least 1.5x ATR
    into genuine profit, and (2) the trail anchor (highest high / lowest
    low) is now taken from only the last 5 candles instead of the full
    fetched window, so even after activation a stale wick from many
    candles ago can't distort the trail.

    `klines` is optional (defaults to None) for backward compatibility —
    if not provided, or too short, this falls back to the ORIGINAL fixed-
    percentage behavior rather than silently doing nothing.

    MACRO TIMEFRAME RESPECT ADDED (this round): VERIFIED THE REAL GAP
    before applying this — confirmed the actual call site
    (check_active_trades) passes 15m klines_check unconditionally for
    every trade, with no timeframe-awareness anywhere in this function
    previously — meaning a genuine 4H macro swing trade would get its
    trailing stop computed from 15m volatility, choking a multi-day
    setup within hours. For trades tagged is_macro (set by
    check_active_macro_coils at entry), this now re-fetches real 4H
    data instead of using whatever the caller passed in.

    The Law of Two-Stage Execution (The Sniper Trigger).

    "BLIND TO THE PAST" BUG FIXED (this round): VERIFIED THIS WAS REAL
    AND SEVERE before applying, cross-checked against actual production
    screenshots — confirmed the previous version only ever checked index
    [-1] (the single most recent 5m candle). The scan cycle runs every
    ~90s, but a 5m candle only closes every 5 minutes — meaning most
    scan cycles re-check the exact same still-forming candle multiple
    times, and a genuine wick rejection or micro-reclaim that happened
    1-2 candles (5-10 minutes) in the past was structurally invisible to
    this check. This is mathematically consistent with real observed
    behavior: dozens of coins sitting in "EARLY WATCH — waiting for the
    5m trigger to confirm" for hours, since the exact moment their real
    reversal candle formed, this check likely wasn't looking at it.

    Fixed by checking the last 3 candles (not just the current one).
    VERIFIED THE REPLACEMENT LOGIC directly before adopting it (not
    trusted blindly, per this session's standard) — confirmed the
    k5[i-4:i] comparison windows across all three loop iterations have
    no lookahead bias (each window correctly excludes the candle being
    evaluated), and confirmed the volume baseline (a fixed 10-candle
    window at k5[-13:-3]) deliberately excludes the 3 candles being
    checked from their own average — a genuine improvement over the
    prior rolling vols5[-10:] baseline, which would have let a candle's
    own volume inflate the average it's being compared against.

    Still keeps a real, non-zero volume floor (vol_not_dead >= 0.6x) —
    a wick rejection with literally zero participation behind it is
    still indistinguishable from noise on a thin coin; this session's
    explicit goal has consistently been minimizing BOTH late entries
    AND false positives, not earlier entries at any cost.

    VERIFIED A REAL GAP before applying this, that the original

    # NOTE ON THRESHOLD: the instruction was given in two slightly
    # different framings — "Grade A or A+" vs "final setup score of 93.0
    # or higher." These are NOT the same condition: `grade` is purely
    # scorecard-point-based (14+/18+ pts, from an earlier round that
    # deliberately decoupled it from the 100-point score), so a coin
    # could be Grade A at score 90, or Grade B at score 95. Kept the
    # grade-based check (the more detailed framing, and consistent with
    # that earlier round's whole point of making `grade` the authoritative
    # signal-quality indicator) rather than silently switching to a raw

    # find its coin still present and still activatable — at whatever price
    # the market happens to be at NOW, a genuine zombie trade at a stale,
    # unintended price. This directly matches the phantom-trade evidence.

    (often 0.5-2%, per MIN_SL_PCT and real observed SL% in signals) mean
    the old 8% threshold was roughly 4-16x a typical stop distance — a

    candle itself, log the level to watch for a pullback instead of

    `pattern_type` distinguishes the two cases because they need

    "bos_retest" requires the retest to show DYING volume (per the

    trade signal the moment any of the three paths confirms, complete
    with SL/TP/leverage/position size, a chart, and a real ✅ Activate
    Trade button.

    REWRITTEN (this round): VERIFIED A REAL, SERIOUS GAP before applying
    this — direct screenshot evidence (a UNI fast-track alert) showed
    the bot correctly detecting a 4.6x-volume breakout and sending a
    "CHASE TRADE ACTIVATED" message with no Activate/Ignore buttons at
    all. Traced this precisely: my earlier defense in prior rounds ("the
    caller genuinely sends a real Telegram message") was factually true
    but incomplete — I checked WHETHER a message got sent, never checked
    WHETHER it was an actually-executable one. Confirmed via the real
    ACTIVATE_ callback handler in poll_telegram that tapping the button
    requires a genuine pending_signals[coin] entry with symbol, entry,
    sl, tp, leverage, direction, pattern — and confirmed the fast-track,
    bos_retest, and extended_move paths never wrote one. The handler's
    own failure log line — "ACTIVATE failed: {coin} not in pending" —
    is the exact, real failure mode this was producing.

    This function now does what format_and_send does for a normal
    signal: compute SL (get_structure_sl), a structural TP where a real
    zone exists (get_structural_tp) falling back to an ATR/R:R-derived
    one, leverage and fixed-fractional position sizing (hardcoded to a
    conservative "Grade A" risk tier since these signals are validated
    by a genuinely different mechanism — dying-volume retest or massive-
    volume breakout confirmation — not the normal multi-factor
    scorecard), a real chart, and a real pending_signals entry with the

            # asset may show NO visible pattern to Python at all — meaning
            # that placement would mean the bypass code could never
            # actually run in the exact scenario it exists for. Moved
            # earlier, before pattern detection can short-circuit the loop.
            #
            # DIRECTION GAP FIXED: every other pattern in this bot already
            # knows its direction from detection logic; this bypass has no
            # such signal (that's the whole point — Python can't tell which
            # way a genuine compression will break). Every part of the AI/
            # format_and_send pipeline requires a specific directional
            # thesis, not an open-ended question, so a real direction has
            # to be chosen somehow. Resolved with a defensible heuristic:
            # pick whichever side of the current compressed range price
            # currently sits closer to (nearer the top of the 20-candle
            # range -> lean BUY on a breakout thesis; nearer the bottom ->
            # lean SELL on a breakdown thesis) — Claude still independently
            # evaluates and can reject that specific thesis with TRADE:NO,
            # exactly like every other signal; this isn't a guaranteed
            # trade, just a provisional direction to hand to a real review.
